# Per-release settings.
#
# Every cluster release should be disabled by default here and
# then explicitly enabled in the base or environment overrides file.
#
# Supported per-release configuration options:
# - enabled (bool) - Whether the release is enabled in a given environment
# - repo (string) - Name of the Helm repo the chart should be pulled from (default "terra-helm")
# - chartVersion (string) - What version of the chart should be deployed
# - chartName (string) - Override for the name of a helm chart to use for a release
#                        (defaults to release name)
# - namespace (string) - Namespace where this chart should be deployed.
#
# Notes:
# - Default versions for every chart are configured in `versions/cluster/dev.yaml`
# - Many of these releases are deployed to the default namespace for historical reasons.
#   All NEW releases should be deployed in dedicated namespaces.
#   Note that our Terra environment namespaces follow the convention `terra-<env>`.
#   Cluster release namespaces should NOT be prefixed with `terra-`.
