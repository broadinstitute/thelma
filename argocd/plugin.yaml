spec:
  # Thelma has a config profile named "argocd" that provides helpful defaults for running Thelma within an ArgoCD on GKE.
  # This file doesn't offer a clean way to specify the THELMA_CONFIG_PROFILE environment variable to set it (at least,
  # not in any way where it could be safely overridden later) so we leave that up whoever is configuring this plugin with
  # ArgoCD. Since ArgoCD isn't interactive, the "ci" profile will be chosen by default.

  generate:
    command: ["thelma", "render"]
    args:
      # ArgoCD requires all plugins to return manifests (and nothing but manifests) to STDOUT
      - "--stdout"
      # Enable parsing other parameters below
      - "--flags-from-environment-prefix=PARAM_"
  # Parameter declarations are for UI sugar only. They have no bearing on what actually gets passed to the Thelma:
  # even the `string` default values aren't passed, and it's up to Thelma to supply these defaults internally.
  #
  # ArgoCD will convert parameter names to environment variables by uppercasing them and replacing dashes with
  # underscores with a PARAM_ prefix, same as how Thelma handles --flags-from-environment-prefix=PARAM_.
